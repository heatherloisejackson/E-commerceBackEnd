# E-commerceBackEnd
Back End of an E-Commerce website that uses Express.js and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Description
The application here is great back end code for any owner/manager at a retail company that would like to create a website to display their products. The code here allows for a site that can display products by categories or tags, which modernizes any online retailer so that web traffic can search through their inventory in a variety of ways and even find other products they would be likely to purchase. Web managers have access to all basic needs for organization with the following actions:
- view all existing categories, products, and tags
- view individual categories, products, and tags
- create new categories, products, and tags
- update categories, products and tags
- delete existing categories, products, and tags

E-CommerceBackEnd is just back-end code, made up of JavaScript using Express.js and Sequelize. MySQL Workbench allows the user to create a database and Insomnia allows the user to test the api routes. This application began with starter code, but tested my knowlege of models and routes and my new understanding of Sequelize. By using a variety of applications to test the functionality of this code I was able to strengthen my skills with the command line, seeds, and Insomnia.

## Installation
Clone this application onto your machine through GitHub, then open it in the command line and run the command "npm install" to make sure all the features are installed for the application locally. Update the seeds files with your own data. Run the command "npm seed" in order to sync the data and paste the Schema in MySQL Workbench. Next, run the command "node server.js" to begin. Using Insomnia you can test all CRUD operations.
